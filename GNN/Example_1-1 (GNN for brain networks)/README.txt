## Task 3

* Run sequentially after task 1 and task 2.

* If in some cases you want to skip task 1 and 2, run until encounter sub-section `4. Traditional Supervised Learning - RandomForest` in the section `task 1` and stop there. Then go to section `task 2` and continue running until encounter sub-section `2. Defining the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and training`. Then go to section `task 3` and run the rest
